Version Identification</h1>
<p>As the JasPer software continues to evolve over time, it is important to be able to identify particular releases of the software. Every release of the JasPer software is named by a version identifier. A version identifier is comprised of three integers separated by dots. In order, the three integers correspond to the major, minor, and micro version numbers for the software. For example, the version identifier "1.500.0" corresponds to a major version of 1, a minor version of 500, and a micro version of 0. In instances where the micro version is zero, the version identifier may be truncated after the minor version number. For example, the version identifier "1.500" is completely valid and simply an abbreviation for "1.500.0".</p>
<p>Given two different releases of the JasPer software, one can easily determine which one is more recent by comparing the version identifiers, as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>if the major version numbers differ, the release with the higher major version number is newer;</li>
<li>if the major version numbers are equal and the minor version numbers differ, the release with the higher minor version number is newer; or</li>
<li>if the major version numbers are equal and the minor version numbers are equal, the release with the higher micro version is newer.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install__obtaining"></a>
Obtaining the Software</h1>
<p>The latest version of the JasPer software can be downloaded from the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>JasPer Project GitHub Releases Page, <a href="https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/releases">https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/releases</a> (The official releases of JasPer can be found here.)</li>
<li>JasPer Project Home Page, <a href="https://jasper-software.github.io/jasper">https://jasper-software.github.io/jasper</a></li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install__extracting"></a>
Extracting the Software</h1>
<p>The JasPer software is distributed in the form of a gzipped tar archive. Therefore, in order to extract the contents of this file, a program capable of handling gzipped tar archives is required. Such software is readily available for most modern computing platforms.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install__prereqs"></a>
Prerequisites for Building (Software Dependencies)</h1>
<p>The JasPer code should compile and run on any platform with a C language implementation conforming to ISO/IEC 9899:2011 <b>[iso9899-2011]</b> (i.e., the ISO C language standard) and supporting a subset of ISO/IEC 9945-1 <b>[iso9945p1]</b> (i.e., the POSIX C API). Only limited POSIX support is required (e.g., the <code>open</code>, <code>close</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>lseek</code> functions must be supported).</p>
<p>If you need a C compiler that is reasonably compliant with the ISO/IEC 9899:2011 standard, you can obtain GNU C from the GNU Project web site (i.e., <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>). If you need the CMake software, this can be obtained from the official CMake web site (i.e., <a href="https://cmake.org">https://cmake.org</a>).</p>
<p>If you are unfortunate enough to have a compiler that is not compliant with ISO/IEC 9899:2011, you may need to make some changes to the code. Unfortunately, even some of the most popular C language implementations do not strictly comply with the standard. One such example is Microsoft Visual C 6.0. Due to the popularity of Visual C, however, several workarounds have been added to the JasPer code to ensure that it will compile successfully with Visual C.</p>
<p>Portability was a major consideration during the design of the JasPer software. For this reason, the software makes minimal assumptions about the runtime environment. The code uses very little floating-point arithmetic, most of which can be attributed to floating-point conversions in invocations of the <code>printf</code> function. This minimal use of floating-point arithmetic should make the code much easier to port to platforms lacking hardware support for floating-point arithmetic.</p>
<p>In order to have access to the full functionality of the JasPer sofware, you may need to install some additional software on your system. This software must be installed before you attempt to build JasPer.</p>
<p>In order to build the JasPer software with JPEG support, you will need to download and install the free IJG JPEG library which is available from the IJG web site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ijg.org">http://www.ijg.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to build the JasPer software with HEIC support, the Libheif library is needed. This library is available from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/strukturag/libheif">https://github.com/strukturag/libheif</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to build the jiv application, you will need the OpenGL and GLUT libraries installed on your system. Most modern systems include OpenGL support (including Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows). The GLUT library is relatively less common and, therefore, may not be installed on your system. To obtain the GLUT library, one can visit:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net">http://freeglut.sourceforge.net</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on the OpenGL library, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.opengl.org">http://www.opengl.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install__building"></a>
Building the Software</h1>
<p>Obviously, before the software can be built, the contents of the archive file containing the JasPer distribution must be extracted.</p>
<p>The JasPer software is intended to be built using CMake, a very popular cross-platform build tool. The current version of the JasPer software should compile on most modern Unix variants such as Linux and MacOS as well as Microsoft Windows. The continuous integration (CI) framework on GitHub used for JasPer development includes builds for the following environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the GCC and Clang C compilers on Ubuntu Linux</li>
<li>the GCC and Clang C compiler on MacOS</li>
<li>the Microsoft Visual C (MSVC) compiler on Microsoft Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the lead JasPer developer uses both the GCC and Clang compilers on Fedora Linux for much of their work. So, the JasPer software should build fairly reliably in these environments. Of course, the software should compile successfully in many other environments as well.</p>
<pre class="fragment">Installation
============

The process required to install JasPer is described below.

Installation on Systems Running Unix
------------------------------------

In what follows, let $SOURCE_DIR denote the top-level directory of the JasPer
software source tree (i.e., the directory containing the files named LICENSE
and INSTALL) and let $INSTALL_DIR denote the target directory for installation.
To build the software, the following steps are required (in order):

  1. Select an empty directory to use for building the software.
  Let $BUILD_DIR denote this directory.

  2. Configure the software using CMake.
  To do this, invoke the command:

      cmake -H$SOURCE_DIR -B$BUILD_DIR -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_DIR \
        $OPTIONS

  where $OPTIONS corresponds to zero or more -D options as described below
  under the heading "Cmake Options".

  This process allows important information about the system configuration
  to be determined.  Unless you know what you are doing (or have problems
  with the default build settings), it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you
  not override the default build settings.

  3. Build the software using CMake.
  To do this, invoke the command:

      cmake --build $BUILD_DIR

  (Assuming that the build operation was successful, the executables
  for the JasPer application programs should be located in the directory
  $BUILD_DIR/src/app.)

  4. Run the test suite to ensure that the software seems to be working
  correctly.  To do this, invoke the commands:

    cd $BUILD_DIR
    ctest --output-on-failure

  5. Install the software (i.e., the library, application programs,
  header files, and other auxiliary data).
  To do this, invoke the command:

      cmake --build $BUILD_DIR --target install

  This step may require special (e.g., administrator) privileges depending
  on the target directory for installation.  (On Unix-based systems,
  the default installation directory is typically under usr/local.)

  Assuming that the software was installed successfully, the executables
  for the JasPer application programs should be found somewhere under
  the $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directory (e.g., $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin).

Additional Remarks:

When building the JasPer software under Mac OSX, only the use of the native
framework for OpenGL is officially supported.  If the Freeglut library
is installed on your system, you will need to ensure that the native GLUT
library (as opposed to the Freeglut library) is used by the build process.
This can be accomplished by adding an extra option to the cmake command line
that resembles the following:

    -DGLUT_glut_LIBRARY=/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework

Installation on Systems Running Microsoft Windows
-------------------------------------------------

In what follows, let %SOURCE_DIR% denote the top-level directory of the
JasPer software source tree (i.e., the directory containing the files
named LICENSE and INSTALL) and let %INSTALL_DIR% denote the target
directory for installation.

1) Select an empty directory to use for building the software.
Let %BUILD_DIR% denote this directory.

2) Generate the project file needed to build the software with Microsoft
Visual Studio.  To do this, invoke the command:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" -H%SOURCE_DIR% -B%BUILD_DIR% ^
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%INSTALL_DIR% %OPTIONS%

where %OPTIONS% corresponds to zero or more -D options as described
below under the heading "Cmake Options".  (Note the caret symbol "^"
above denotes line continuation.)

3) Build and install the software.  To do this, invoke the command:

    msbuild %build_dir%\INSTALL.vcxproj

Other Remarks
-------------

In some cases, it may be necessary to explicitly disable the use of the
IJG JPEG library (i.e., libjpeg).  This is accomplished through a CMake
configuration option.  (See the "CMake Options" section below.)  For example,
such action may be required if the version of the JPEG library installed
on your system is not compatible with the version of JasPer being built.
Also, when building under the Cygwin environment, it may be necessary to
explicitly disable the use of the JPEG library.

In some situations, it may be necessary to explicitly disable the use of the
OpenGL libraries.  This is accomplished through a CMake configuration option.
(See the "CMake Options" section below.)

CMake Options
-------------

The option OPTION can be set to the value VALUE with a command-line option
of the form -DOPTION=VALUE
The following options are supported:

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
    Specify the installation directory.
    Value: A directory name.

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
    Specify the build type (i.e., release or debug).
    Valid values: Debug or Release

JAS_ENABLE_MULTITHREADING_SUPPORT
    Specify if the library should include multithreading support.
    Valid values: true and false

JAS_PREFER_PTHREAD
    Specify if the POSIX Threads library should be preferred over native
    C11 threading support.
    Valid values: true and false

JAS_ENABLE_PROGRAMS
    Specify if the demo application programs should be built/installed.
    Valid values: true and false

JAS_ENABLE_DOC
    Enable the building of the documentation (which requires LaTeX).
    Valid values: true and false

JAS_ENABLE_LIBJPEG
    Enable the use of the JPEG library
    Valid values: true and false

JAS_ENABLE_OPENGL
    Enable the use of the OpenGL and GLUT libraries.
    Valid values: true and false

JAS_ENABLE_SHARED
    Enable the building of shared libraries.
    Valid values: true or false

JAS_ENABLE_HIDDEN
    Hide internal symbols?  Enabling this results in a smaller binary.
    Valid values: true or false

JAS_ENABLE_32BIT
    Force the use of 32 bit integers?  On 64 bit CPUs, JasPer
    historically used 64 bit integers which consumes more memory, is
    slower and has no advantages.  This produces a different ABI, so
    the resulting library is not compatible with other builds.
    Valid values: true or false

JAS_DEFAULT_MAX_MEM_USAGE
    Specify the maximum amount of memory (in bytes) that may be used by
    the library.
    This value is only a default and can be overridden at run time.
    Valid value: a (strictly) positive integer

JAS_INCLUDE_BMP_CODEC
JAS_INCLUDE_JP2_CODEC
JAS_INCLUDE_JPC_CODEC
JAS_INCLUDE_JPG_CODEC
JAS_INCLUDE_MIF_CODEC
JAS_INCLUDE_PGX_CODEC
JAS_INCLUDE_PNM_CODEC
JAS_INCLUDE_RAS_CODEC
    Include support for the specified codec in the library.
    (This support can still be disabled at run time.)
    Valid values: true or false

JAS_ENABLE_BMP_CODEC
JAS_ENABLE_JP2_CODEC
JAS_ENABLE_JPC_CODEC
JAS_ENABLE_JPG_CODEC
JAS_ENABLE_MIF_CODEC
JAS_ENABLE_PGX_CODEC
JAS_ENABLE_PNM_CODEC
JAS_ENABLE_RAS_CODEC
    Enable support for the specified codec by default at run time.
    Valid values: true or false

JAS_ENABLE_ASAN
    Enable the Address Sanitizer.
    Valid values: true or false

JAS_ENABLE_UBSAN
    Enable the Undefined-Behavior Sanitizer.
    Valid values: true or false

JAS_ENABLE_LSAN
    Enable the Leak Sanitizer.
    Valid values: true or false

JAS_ENABLE_MSAN
    Enable the Memory Sanitizer.
    Valid values: true or false
